# üìà Financial Time Series Forecasting with ARCH/GARCH Models

This project explores **volatility modeling** and **forecasting techniques** in financial time series, particularly focused on stock return behavior using models like **ARCH**, **GARCH**, and their extensions. It forms part of a larger series on practical time series methods, each accompanied by corresponding YouTube talks.

## üîπ Overview

This notebook focuses on modeling **volatility clustering** observed in financial time series (e.g., stock prices like TATASTEEL), using techniques including:

* Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (**ARCH**) models
* Generalized ARCH (**GARCH**) models
* Extensions like **ARMA-GARCH**, **TARCH**, and **GJR-GARCH**
* Risk metrics such as **Value at Risk (VaR)**

These models are useful for:

* Capturing time-varying volatility
* Forecasting risk
* Financial econometrics and quantitative finance

## üß∞ Key Concepts

### Volatility Clustering

Periods of high volatility tend to be followed by high volatility, and calm periods follow calm ones.

### ARCH Model

Models time-varying conditional variance based on past squared residuals.

### GARCH Model

Extends ARCH by including past variance terms (autoregressive volatility).

### Value at Risk (VaR)

A risk measure estimating potential losses over a specific time frame and confidence level.

To set up this project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-ts-forecasting.git
cd financial-ts-forecasting
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements include:

## üîÆ Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to:

```bash
jupyter notebook financial-volatility-modeling.ipynb
```

Inside the notebook:

1. Load and preprocess stock market data (e.g., TATASTEEL or S\&P 500).
2. Visualize returns and squared returns.
3. Apply ARCH and GARCH models using `arch` library.
4. Conduct diagnostic tests: Ljung-Box, Engle's ARCH test.
5. Forecast volatility and compute VaR.

## üìä Outputs

* **Volatility Estimates**: Plots of conditional volatility over time.
* **Model Summary**: Parameters and significance levels.
* **Residual Diagnostics**: ACF/PACF plots of residuals and squared residuals.
* **Value at Risk (VaR)**: 1% and 5% quantile loss thresholds with exceedance visualizations.

## ‚ú® Extensions

* ARMA-GARCH: Joint modeling of mean and variance.
* TARCH / GJR: Asymmetric volatility models.
* Skewed-t distribution innovations.
* Forecast evaluation with rolling windows.
